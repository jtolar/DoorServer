# DoorServer

The Door Server project is a server that will allow you to host your own door server for your bbs or create a hosted door server like Door Party. 
It is a modernized version of [Rick Parrish's GameSvr project](https://github.com/rickparrish/GameSrv). GameSvr was never fully completed even though it worked. We love the work Rick did 
and want to modernize the codebase and finish the project.

At a minimum Door Server will run a Rlogin server and pass the user through to the door game specified. We have built a working Proxy for DoorParty.
Future plans include a command generator for various bbs software, a door game repository with automatic configuration and hopefully more.
